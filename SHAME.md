Pieces of tech debt I have intentionally accrued to accelerate development:

- Using relative module paths instead of custom Webpack aliases. (This is a bit tricky because I have to poke around under the hood of Create React App to get it working.)

- Bug in Material UI top navigation bar selection state. (Sometimes double tap is required to moe from Weather tab to View Garden).
